    <h1> Airbnb In Boston Analysis</h1>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>Our central research question is to explore and analyze different features of highly rated airbnb’s in Boston.
        Our working definition of highly rated airbnb’s would be airbnb’s that have an overall rating of 4 stars and
        above. Airbnb as a business has been under a lot of pressure lately regarding their business practice of
        displacing the native population from their neighborhoods. Due to this, increased housing prices and the
        displacement of minority populations has caused some state legislation to ban airbnb. Boston has been one city
        that has been considering this alternative. Disrupting the airbnb market would be a huge win for residents of
        the city, but this begs the question– how will this ban of the majority of airbnb properties affect the overall
        housing market in one of the most expensive cities to live in? Our analysis will uncover what features and
        prices influence what is considered a highly rated airbnb and how these different airbnb’s influence the housing
        market. We hope to provide interesting data visualizations that show what area these airbnb’s are in and how
        these locations are suffering from the negative impact of airbnb’s.

    <h3>Introduction to the data</h3>

    <p> The dataset we chose is sourced from Kaggle, and provides information about the listing activity of homestays in
        Boston, MA, collected since 2008 through the Airbnb platform. The dataset is specifically focused on the Boston
        area and contains a total of 3,585 rows and 95 columns. The detail information about some of the key property
        characteristics
        are listed in the following table:</p>

    <div class="center">
        <table class="tg">
            <thead>

    <h3>Relationship Between Property Type and Rating</h3>

    <div class='container'>
        <div class='image'>
            <!-- <iframe src="histogram/index.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>-->
            <iframe src="histogram/histogram.png" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>
        <div class='text'>
            <p>
                The bar chart reveals insightful patterns about how different types of properties are rated on average.
                It's notable that properties where the entire floor is included, perhaps indicating more spacious or
                exclusive accommodations, tend to receive the highest mean ratings. On the other hand, dorm-style
                accommodations, which often offer shared spaces and more basic amenities, tend to have the lowest mean
                ratings.

                While there is a discernible difference between the highest and lowest mean ratings, it's interesting to
                note that the contrast isn't as significant as one might expect. This suggests that while certain types
                of properties may be inherently more appealing to guests, factors such as the overall quality of
                service, cleanliness, communication, and amenities provided can significantly influence ratings across
                different property types.

    <h3>Relationship Between Property Type and Airbnb Price</h3>

    <div class='container'>
        <div class='image'>
            <!-- <iframe src="histogram/index.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>-->
            <iframe src="boxplot2.png" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>
        <div class='text'>
            <p>
               The boxplot also shows the relationship between the different property types and price for the Airbnb's in Boston.
               Property types like boats had the highest price on average, with an average of about $4250, whereas the Camper/RV and Dorm property types
               had the lowest prices on average, with an average of about $50. It is notable that there is a difference of about $200 between the highest
               and lowest average prices. 
               The property type with the widest range of price was aprtments with a maximum price of about $400 and a minimum price 
               under $50. The property type with the smallest range of price was Camper/RV with a price of about $50. 
               It is interesting to see how the type of property in Boston changes the price. Airbnb's with higher prices
               may be a higher quality, therefore increasing the price.
            </p>

    <h3>Relationship Between Property Type and Number of Accommodates</h3>

    <p>We also made an interactive graph using D3 that shows the relationship between the property type of the 
        Airbnb and the maximum number of accommodates staying in that property. We hoped to discover what kinds of 
        property types are suitable for a larger or smaller number of accommodates.
        The interactive component is that hovering the mouse over one bar of the graph will result in
        a part of that bar changing color, showing the number of accommodates corresponding to the property 
        type for each data point.
    </p>

    <div class='center'>
        <a href="d3 barplot/barplot.html">Property type vs. Number of Accomodates</a>
    </div>

    <p>In general, houses was the property type with the highest maxium number of accomodates at around 16. 
        Dorms had the last with a maximum of under 4 accomodates. In conclusion, this data can help
        future customers look for Airbnb properties corresponding to the size of their group.
        For example, if a group is looking for an Airbnb in Boston and they have a greater number of accommodates,
        according to the data, they should look for apartments as they seem to be able to 
        hold a larger number of accomodates. 
    </p>
    
    
    <p>Meanwhile, we also believe that the geographical
        information is important when evaluating the unemployment
        rate. Therefore, we also make use of geographical information
        on <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/">Natural Earth</a>.
        The website provides the geographical information for making maps for US states.
    </p>

    <p>To make a better data visualization, we remove the Alaska and Hawaii
        from the data. Following is an interactive map for the
        lower 48 states in US. User can zoom in the map. The color
        indicates the unemployment rate for each state. When click any
        state, other social factors will be revealed for the state. </p>

    <div class='center'>
        <iframe src="map.html" width="80%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>In general, west coast states tend to have higher
        unemployment rate. On the east coast, West virginia
        and New York state tend to have higher unemplyment rate
        than the others. In the south, Mississippi and Louisiana
        are the ones with the much higher unemplyment rate.
    </p>

    
    <h3> The relationship between unemployment rate and other social factors</h3>

    <div class='container'>
        <div class='text'>
            <p>Moreover, we also want to examine the relationship between
                unemployment rate and other social factors in the data. All
                features are numerical thus we firts create a correlation
                plot to examine whether there are linear relationship between
                unemployment rate with other social factors. Notice that if
                the correlation is small, it only means that there is no potential
                linear relationship between two features.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on the correlation plot, among all the features, poverty
                has the strongest correlation with the unemployment rate since
                they are both related to the economics. The percentage of single
                parents is the second important feature which inidicates the
                stability of family is also strongly related to the job market.
                The increase of unemployment rate may also related to the increase
                of violent crime and murder rate but has a negative relationship
                with education indicators, like the percentage of people who go to
                high school and college. The only variable that has no direct linear
                relation with the unemployment rate is Metropolitan, which means the
                percent of residents living in a metropolitan area.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class='image'>
            <img src="correlation_plot.png" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></img>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>We created an interactive scatter plot so that
        our users can select a couple of states within
        a certain range of unemployment rate and to see how the
        other factors may be related here.
    </p>

    <div class='center'>
        <iframe src="scatter.html" width="85%" height="550px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>We also created another interactive scatter plot that shows the relationship between accommodates, 
        price, and rating. Users can determine the number of accommodates they want first and 
        then check out the pricing range for that specific number of accommodates. While looking
        at the plot users can also see an specific airbnb's rating along with the number of 
        accommodates and price.</p>

        <div class='center'>
            <iframe src="scatter2.html" width="85%" height="550px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>

    <h3>Compare MA to the other states</h3>

    <p>
        Since we are in MA, thus we want to take a closer look between
        MA and other states. We create the following interactive plot
        such that user can choose another state to compare with MA and
        show the bar plot on each factors.
    </p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>
        In this visualization analysis, we what features and prices influence what is considered a highly rated airbnb
        and how these different airbnb’s influence the housing market. Out data visualizations that show what area these
        airbnb’s are in and how these locations are suffering from the negative impact of airbnb’s.

    <ul> <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <li>Most Airbnbs are located in the Back Bay and Kenmore regions.</li>
        <li>Airbnbs in the Roxbury region might contribute to rent price increases.</li>
        <li>There are fewer Airbnbs as you move away from the city.</li>
        <li>Higher ratings of Airbnbs correlate with more private rental spaces.</li>
        <li>There is a lot of variability in prices concerning cancellation policies, property types, and the number of
            accommodates.</li>
    </ul>
